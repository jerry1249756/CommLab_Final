## Introduction

In this project, we implemented several entropy encoding schemes and analyzed the trade-off between efficiency and quality. Our experimental results matched our hypothesis. We concluded that the use of Asymmetric Numeral Systems (ANS) not only speeds up the entire encoding process but also maintains high quality under extreme conditions. It is no surprise that ANS has become the favored compression method for many companies, including Google, Apple, Facebook, and Nvidia.
